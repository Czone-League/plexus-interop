Plexus Interop project aim is to define open standards for desktop application interop and provide reference
implementations of these standards. It formalizes application launch, lifecycle tracking and communication between
running applications within a single user session on client desktop without crossing  network boundaries.

The main goals for Plexus Interop standards are:

- Provide a unified way of building integrated flows spanning desktop applications from different vendors
- Provide a way to define strong-typed contracts between applications in a declarative way and auto-generate
strong-typed app-specific API to simplify integration between different technologies and teams
- Support any possible desktop application technology, framework or container
- Allow launching desktop applications on demand
- De-couple applications from each other, allow independent releases and dynamic discovery of available services
- Support restricted desktop environments without admin or other special permissions
