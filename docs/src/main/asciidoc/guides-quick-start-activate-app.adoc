[NOTE]
====
`plexus activate` command sends request to launch the app with the given ID to *App Lifecycle Manager* - the component inside broker
which tracks active apps and can initiate app launch when required. Each app defined in app registry has associated *App Launcher*
which can perform actual launch of the app, so the Lifecycle Manager just redirects launch request to the App Launcher specified for the given app.
