==== How to run samples

:imagesdir: ./images

Successful build (see <<how-to-build, How to build>>) on Windows machine produces sample apps into directory `bin/win-x86/samples`.

Let's go through the most extensive example showing .NET and Web apps interoperability as well as service discovery feature:

* Go to `bin/win-x86/samples`

* Launch Broker – `LaunchBroker.cmd`

* Launch Greeting Client – `LaunchGreetingClient.cmd`

* Choose “Discovery” option (5) and then “Greeting from Electron Web app” option from discovery response:

* Enter name, e.g. “John” and hit enter. `WebGreetingServer` app will be launched by `Broker` request using `ElectronAppLauncher`.
The app will print the received name and send back greeting response:

* Greeting client app should receive the greeting and print it:

* Choose Discovery (5) again and this time select “Greeting from .Net app” option from discovery results.

* Enter another name, e.g. “Mike” and hit enter - .NET `GreetingServer` app will be launched, print the received name and send back greeting:

* You can explore other examples by choosing other options in `GreetingClient` app.
