==== Quick Start - .NET

In this guide both consumer and provider are .NET console applications written in C# language running using https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/runtime[.NET Core].

===== Run example

include::guides-quick-start-launch-broker-step.adoc[]

. Launch `CcyPairRateViewer`:
+
[source, bash]
-----
plexus activate vendorB.fx.CcyPairRateViewer
-----
+
include::guides-quick-start-activate-app.adoc[]
+
[NOTE]
====
In this example apps are launched using built-in `NativeAppLauncher` which run apps as usual processes by executing specified file with arguments.
====

. In the opened console window enter a currency pair name, e.g. `EURUSD` and press `Enter`:

+
[NOTE]
====
In this example `CcyPairRateProvider` app is a provider of `CcyPairRateService`, so broker starts it by sending request to `NativeAppLauncher`
and then redirects invocation to the launched instance.
====

. Broker starts `CcyPairRateProvider` app and redirects request to it:

. The viewer app shows the rate received from provider:

===== Update example

Let's take a closer look to example and improve the provided service with ability to provide real-time updates.
We're going to change contract between two applications, pass the changed interop metadata to broker, update apps and run them again.

====== Update metadata

Open `registry/fx/CcyPairRateService.proto` file and add new `GetRateStream` method:

[source, proto]
./registry/fx/CcyPairRateService.proto
-----
service CcyPairRateService {
    rpc GetRate(CcyPair) returns (CcyPairRate);
    // new rpc call returning real-time notification stream
    rpc GetRateStream(CcyPair) returns (stream CcyPairRate);
}
