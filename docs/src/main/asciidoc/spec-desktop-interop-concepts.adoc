Desktop Interop consist of several concepts. This section contains overview diagram which shows how different concepts
are connected and provides brief description for each of them.

===== Application

Application is a program on client desktop which can be started and stopped. Each application can provide services
and/or consume services provided by other applications.

Application is not necessary correspond to OS process. It can be a part of process, or consist of many processes.
Examples of applications:

* A program with GUI
* A program without GUI, e.g. Windows Service
* A part of process, e.g. a plugin running in a big container application consisting of many isolated plugins
* A web window or worker in Electron.js or other web container

====== Application Instance

Application instance is a running (started) application. There can be many instances of the same application running
simultaneously on client desktop.

===== Interop Registry

Interop registry defines strong-typed contracts between applications on client desktop.

It consist of definitions of the following types:

* Message definitions represent types of data which can be sent between applications.
* Service definitions represent named sets of related methods which can be implemented by applications. Each service method
is defined by its name, type, and types of request and response.
* Application definitions declare which service implementations are provided and which consumed
by each application participating in desktop interop.

===== Broker

Broker is the central part of desktop interop. Broker accepts, authenticates and tracks application (client) connections,
validates and routes calls between them, and optionally can trigger launch of application on demand.

Broker listens to one or many wire protocol servers to accept client connections. Applications can use any of the listened
wire protocol implementations to establish connection with broker.

Application instance is considered "online" while it has at least one established connection with broker. Broker
uniquely identifies each connection and tracks it, so it always knows which apps are online in any given time.

Online applications instances can send protocol requests to broker to discover or call service implementations provided
by other applications. Broker validates and routes such calls to target applications according to interop registry.

===== Client

Client is a library used by application to connect to interop broker. Client can be implemented in any language,
it communicates with broker using interop protocol, transport protocol and wire protocols.

===== Interop Protocol

Interop Protocol is a language for conversations between client and broker through transport channels.

It consist of 4 main types of conversations:

* Connect handshake - the first conversation performed after new transport connection is established
* Disconnect handshake - the last conversation performed before transport connection is closed
* Discovery - request from application to broker to get the available services filtered by specific parameters
* Method call - request from an application to call a method implemented in another application

Each interop protocol conversation is performed within a separate transport channel.

===== Application Launcher

Application launchers are applications which can launch other applications. This concept was introduced to de-couple
and allow easy customization of launch workflows, because they can be very different for different apps.
E.g. web application is loaded in a separate browser window, native application just started as a new process and
.NET plugin is loaded by its container application. In addition each vendor can also have custom launch steps like
auto-updating or accepting terms & conditions which can also be implemented in vendor-specific app launcher.

On method call broker can either route the call to an online application instance or trigger launch of a new
instance. Each application can specify its launcher in interop registry and broker will delegate launch to
the specified launcher.

===== Transport Protocol

Transport protocol is used to send binary messages between client and broker and is responsible for multiplexing and
de-multiplexing to allow opening many channels simultaneously through a single connection.

====== Transport Connection

Transport connection is an abstraction of established connectivity between client and broker.

Connection is initiated by client and accepted by broker.

Transport implementation must detect if the connection is still alive (e.g. by sending heartbeats)
and raise "disconnected" event on both sides when connectivity is broken.

====== Transport Channel

Transport channel is a logical unit of data exchange through connection. It consist of request and response
byte streams on both sides of connection.

Channel opening can be initiated by both client and broker. It's only possible to write and read bytes to/from
an opened channel. Many channels can be simultaneously opened in the context of the same connection.

For example, for each call from one application to another, 2 transport channels are opened. First is opened by source
application to broker. Second is opened by broker to target application. All the data sent in context of the call
is transferred through these 2 channels.

Bytes written to request stream on one side of channel can be read in exactly the same order from response stream
on another side. As soon as one of the sides sent all the data it closes request stream. This triggers
response stream completion event on another side as soon as all the sent bytes consumed.

Channel considered "Completed" when both sides completed request stream and consumed all the bytes from response stream.
Additionally it can be terminated by either client or broker with either "Failed" or "Canceled" status in case of
exception.

===== Wire Protocol

Wire protocol is an abstraction for sending bytes through cross-process boundaries. Any existing stream-based network
protocol such as named pipe or websocket can be used as wire protocol for Desktop Interop.

Broker can listen to many wire protocols simultaneously on different addresses. Each client can choose one of wire
protocols supported by broker. Usually for native apps it's more convenient to use named pipes and for web apps it's
more convenient to use websockets because most of browsers has native support for them.
