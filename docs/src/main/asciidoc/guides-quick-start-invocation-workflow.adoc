[NOTE]
====
When a service is called, broker does the following:

. Searches for the service providers in *interop registry*.
. If service provider app is offline, launches it by inspecting *app registry* and sending launch request to the appropriate *app launcher*.
. Waits until the launched app connected.
. Redirects the invocation to the service provider app.

See <<guides-interop-invocation-workflow, Invocation Workflow>> section for details.
