[NOTE]
====
When app A calls an interop service hosted in app B the following steps happen:

* Broker searches for the already connected live service providers
* If service provider is offline, broker inspects *App Registry* and sends a launch request to *App Lifecycle Manager*.
* While app is starting broker waits (with some timeout)
* Service provider within the launched app connects to the broker and registers itself
* Broker sends interop message to the service provider

See <<guides-interop-invocation-workflow, Invocation Workflow>> section for details.
