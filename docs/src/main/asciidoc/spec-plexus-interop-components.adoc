Plexus Interop consist of the following main components:

* Broker - a process running on user desktop which handles application connections and routes calls between them
* Client - technology-specific library used by applications to communicate with broker
* Interop DSL - language to define connections between applications and associated tooling for parsing, validation and
code-generation of application-specific client APIs from these definitions

To participate in interop each application need to define itself in Interop Registry and auto-generate its specific
client API using code-generation tool. Broker also uses Interop Registry to validate and route calls.

Both client and broker use transport protocol and interop protocol to communicate with each other. Broker can support
one or more interop and transport protocols. Currently it supports version 1 of interop protocol and 2 versions of
transport protocols: named-pipe-based and websocket-based.
