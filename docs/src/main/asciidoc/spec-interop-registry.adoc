==== Messages and Services

For messages and services definition Plexus uses Google Protobuf v3 format. For example:

....
package fx;

message CcyPair {
  string ccyPairName = 1;
}

message CcyPairRate {
  string ccyPairName = 1;
  double rate = 2;
}

service CcyPairRateService {
  rpc GetRate (CcyPair) returns (CcyPairRate);
}
....

You can find Protobuf specification here - https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3

==== Application Interop Manifests

Application interop manifests are defined using special `.interop` format. Here is an example:

[source, php]
----
package vendorA.fx; // <1>

import "fx/CcyPairRateService.proto"; // <2>

application CcyPairRateProvider { // <3>
    provides fx.CcyPairRateService to vendorA.* { GetRate; } // <4>
    consumes interop.samples.GreetingService from interop.samples.GreetingServer { ShowGreeting; } <5>
    consumes interop.samples.EchoService from interop.* { Echo; } <6>
}
----
<1> Define namespace for application
<2> Import services definition that application provides or consumes
<3> Application name
<4> Provided service definition. In this case app only allows using this implementation for other apps in package "vendorA".
<5> Consumed service definition
<6> One more consumed service definition.

===== Consumes

Consumes notation defines to which Service methods this component can execute. This Methods can be provided by several components
 and they will be accessible by discovery for component client code. We explicitly ask to specify exact methods
to support schema evolution and corner cases where one component produce not the full set of service methods

Imagine the following scenario:

* There is "ServiceA" fully implemented and produced by two components "ComponentA" and "ComponentB"
* We add new additional method to "ServiceA"
* "ComponentA" implements this method, where "ComponentB" is still in progress

Thus exact method import will allow plexus to check if some methods used anywhere, it will allow to check if method is produced by
both components and give error if not.

===== Provides

We ask to provide explicit list of methods for consume and provide notations to support service evolutions and changes.
Plexus will be able to check if what set of methods of specific Service implemented in concrete Component and validate if
all mapping are correct and consistent.
