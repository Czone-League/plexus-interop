Plexus Interop project aim is to define open standard for Desktop Interop - communication between apps on client
desktops - and provide reference implementation of these standards.

Desktop Interop standard only covers communication between applications running on client desktop in a single user
session without crossing network boundaries. Client-server and server-server communication is out of Desktop Interop
scope as well as communication between different users.
