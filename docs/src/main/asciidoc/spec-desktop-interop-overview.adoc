Plexus Interop project aim is to define open standard and provide reference implementation of Desktop Interop solution.

Desktop Interop formalizes application launch, lifecycle tracking and communication within a single user session
on client desktop without crossing  network boundaries. Please note that client-server and server-server communication
is out of scope of Desktop Interop, as well as communication between different users.

The main goals for Desktop Interop standard are:

- Provide a unified way of building integrated flows spanning desktop applications from different vendors
- Provide a way to define strong-typed contracts between applications in a declarative way and auto-generate
strong-typed app-specific API to simplify integration between different technologies and teams
- Support any possible desktop application technology, framework or container
- Allow launching desktop applications on demand
- De-couple applications from each other, allow independent releases and dynamic discovery of available services
- Support restricted desktop environments without admin or other special permissions
