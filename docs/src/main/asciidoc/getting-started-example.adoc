This introduction guide gets you started with Plexus Interop with a simple example of two apps which communicates with each other:

- `vendorA.fx.CcyPairRateProvider` - app developed by Vendor A. The app provides FX pair exchange rates to other apps.
- `vendorB.fx.CcyPairRateViewer` - app developed by Vendor B in TypeScript. The app allows user to request FX pair exchange rate from other apps.

There is a quick start guide for all currently supported Plexus Interop Client's technologies:

- <<quick-start-web, Web (Typescript)>>
- <<quick-start-net, .Net (C#)>>
